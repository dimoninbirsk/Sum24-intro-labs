# Task 1
- Authenticity: Signing a commit using an SSH key proves that the commit was made by the individual associated with the key, preventing unauthorized modifications or impersonation.
- Integrity: The signature guarantees that the commit’s content hasn’t been tampered with after it was signed. This ensures that the code, message, and metadata remain unchanged.

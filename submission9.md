# Lab 9 GitHub Actions

## Task 1 Create Your First GitHub Actions Pipeline

### Key concepts

- GitHub Actions - automation platform built into GitHub that allows developers to automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying code.

- Workflows - define a sequence of actions to perform.

- Actions - individual tasks that are part of a workflow. They are defined as YAML files within a .github/workflows directory in repository.

- Runners - virtual machines hosted by GitHub that run workflows.

### Steps

1. Create ``.github/workflows`` directory and ``github-actions-demo.yml`` in it.
2. In ``github-actions-demo.yml``  paste the template:
```bash
name: GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
```

3. Commit the changes
4. In Actions tab I can see result of workflow execution: ![alt text](image.png)

## Task 2: Gathering System Information and Manual Triggering

### Steps

1. Create new file ``manual_trigger.yml`` that contains 2 jobs: previous template and new one, that consist of commant that helps to explore the system.
To activate this workflow manually, I added ``workflow_dispatch:``

```bash
name: Manual GitHub Actions
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out Manual GitHub Actions üöÄ
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ The job was MANUALLY triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
  Explore-System:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "OS release"
      - run: cat /etc/os-release
      - run: echo "Processor"
      - run: lscpu
      - run: echo "RAM"
      - run: free -m
```

2. Commit the changes.
3. There was a problem, that I cannot see button to manually run the workflow. I solve this by pushing this changes to main branch. In the result button appers and I run this workflow manually.
